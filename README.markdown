# Visualizing sorting algorithms with Inkscape #

Visualizations of sorting algorithms using Scheme scripting in Inkscape.
See [this blog post](http://blog.iangreenleaf.com/2008/11/visualizing-sorting-algorithms.html) for more information.

This code was used to generate a logo for the [Grinnell College Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/).

Unfortunately, this code is based on an old patch to an old version of Inkscape, so it will be pretty hard to run it yourself.

Here's what some of the results look like:

## Merge sort ##

## Quicksort ##
